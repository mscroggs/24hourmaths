From {% include _bst_time.html year="2022" month="9" day="28" hour="19" minute="0" format="{12 HOUR}{am/pm} {TZ} on {WEEKDAY} {DATETH} {MONTHNAME}" %}
until {% include _bst_time.html year="2022" month="9" day="29" hour="19" minute="0" format="{12 HOUR}{am/pm} {TZ} on {WEEKDAY} {DATETH} {MONTHNAME}" %},
we will be running the 24 Hour Maths Game Show.

The show is raising money for four charities: Beat, the Rheumatoid Arthritis Foundation, DEC, and the Malala Fund.
You can donate to one or all of these charities on [our Just Giving page](https://www.justgiving.com/team/24hourmathsgameshow).
If you're a UK taxpayer, you can add Gift Aid to any donations to Beat and DEC (as they're UK-based charities) but not the Rheumatoid Arthritis Foundation
and the Malala fund (as they're non-UK charities).
