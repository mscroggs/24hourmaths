# Taskmathster

For the upcoming [24 Hour Maths Game Show](game-show.md), we need **you** to
record yourself completing some tasks for the Taskmathster segment of the show.

The tasks are included below. You can do as many or as few of these as you want. For each of the tasks you complete, please do the following:

- Record yourself reading out the task and looking like you're thinking about how you're going to do it.


- We will edit together a segment that includes our favourite entries, but the time we have during the show is limited
  so your footage may not be used in the actual 24h show. We'll release a bonus video at some point after the show including all the entries.
  By sending in footage, you agree you're happy for us to put it on our YouTube channel as part of a longer video.

- You should aim to include footage of you preparing for and doing the challenge along with your final entry.
  We can edit it all together, so feel free to send your unedited footage.

- Horizontal (wide) video please!

- Email your entries (a link to an unlisted YouTube video, or a file shared in Dropbox/Google Drive/Google Photos/other filesharing service) to
  **taskmathster@24hourmaths.com** by the deadline of **Friday 21st October at 8pm (BST)**.
