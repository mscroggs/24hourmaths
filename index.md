We're currently planning our second show: the 24 Hour Maths Game Show. It will take place in mid-late 2022.
To keep updated about this and other upcoming shows, sign up to our mailing list below or [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/24hourmaths).

The first 24 Hour Maths show took place in October 2020, when a [group of maths presenters](team.md) got together some mathematicians, 
magicians and other cool people to put on a 24-hour long online YouTube mathematical magic show. Each half-hour had a 
different special guest sharing a mathematical magic trick of some kind, giving a total of 48 tricks for you to watch and 
puzzle over (and since it was Hallowe'en, we included some treats as well).
You can find a full list of guests, and links to their parts of the show [here](magic.md).
