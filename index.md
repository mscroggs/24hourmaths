You will be able to watch the first nine hours of the show at [youtu.be/0CSCjORkZeY](https://youtu.be/0CSCjORkZeY).
Guests on the show will include:

- Numberphile and YouTube star **James Grime**

You can view a list of all the segments we're planning for the 24 Hour Maths Game Show on [the game show page](game-show.md).

The show is raising money for four charities: Beat Eating Disorders, the Rheumatoid Arthritis Foundation, the Disasters Emergency Committee, and the Malala Fund.
You can donate to one or all of these charities on [our Just Giving page](https://www.justgiving.com/team/24hourmathsgameshow).
If you're a UK taxpayer, you can add Gift Aid to any donations to Beat and DEC (as they're UK-based charities) but not the Rheumatoid Arthritis Foundation
and the Malala fund (as they're non-UK charities).

The [first 24 Hour Maths show](magic.md) took place in October 2020, when a [group of maths presenters](team.md) got together some mathematicians, 
magicians and other cool people to put on a 24-hour long online YouTube mathematical magic show. Each half-hour had a 
different special guest sharing a mathematical magic trick of some kind, giving a total of 48 tricks for you to watch and 
puzzle over (and since it was Hallowe'en, we included some treats as well).
You can find a full list of guests, and links to their parts of the show [here](magic.md).
