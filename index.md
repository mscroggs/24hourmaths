The 24 Hour Maths Game Show took place from 7pm BST on Friday 28th October until 7pm BST on Saturday 29th October 2022, and was a celebration of everything maths/games related, including mathematical game shows, game theory, maths games and anything else in the intersection of maths and games.
You can view a list of all the segments that were part of the 24 Hour Maths Game Show on [the game show page](game-show.md), including links to watch them in the recording.

You can still [watch recordings of the show](https://www.youtube.com/@24hmaths) and donate to our four charities: [Beat Eating Disorders](https://www.justgiving.com/beat), the [Rheumatoid Arthritis Foundation](https://www.justgiving.com/rheumatoidarthritisfoundationhelpfightra), the [Disasters Emergency Committee](https://www.justgiving.com/dec), and the [Malala Fund](https://www.justgiving.com/malalafund).
You can see how much we raised during the show on [our Just Giving page](https://www.justgiving.com/team/24hourmathsgameshow). If you're a UK taxpayer, you can add Gift Aid to any donations to Beat and DEC (as they're UK-based charities) but not the Rheumatoid Arthritis Foundation
and the Malala fund (as they're non-UK charities).

The [first 24 Hour Maths show](magic.md) took place in October 2020, when a [group of maths presenters](team.md) got together some mathematicians, 
magicians and other cool people to put on a 24-hour long online YouTube mathematical magic show. Each half-hour had a 
different special guest sharing a mathematical magic trick of some kind, giving a total of 48 tricks for you to watch and 
puzzle over (and since it was Hallowe'en, we included some treats as well).
You can find a full list of guests, and links to their parts of the show [here](magic.md).
