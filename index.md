The [first 24 Hour Maths show](magic.md) took place in October 2020, when a [group of maths presenters](team.md) got together some mathematicians, 
magicians and other cool people to put on a 24-hour long online YouTube mathematical magic show. Each half-hour had a 
different special guest sharing a mathematical magic trick of some kind, giving a total of 48 tricks for you to watch and 
puzzle over (and since it was Hallowe'en, we included some treats as well).
You can find a full list of guests, and links to their parts of the show [here](magic.md).
