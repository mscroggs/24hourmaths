In October 2020, a <a href="http://24hourmaths.com/team.html">group of maths presenters</a> got together some mathematicians, magicians and other cool people to put on a 24-hour long online YouTube mathematical magic show. Each half-hour had a different special guest sharing a mathematical magic trick of some kind, giving a total of 48 tricks for you to watch and puzzle over (and since was Hallowe'en, we included some treats as well).

The guests included:
- Mathematician and RI Christmas Lecturer <strong>Hannah Fry</strong>
- Stand-up Mathematician <strong>Matt Parker</strong>
- Professional speed Rubik's cuber <strong>Sydney Weaver</strong>
- Popular science author <strong>Simon Singh</strong>
- Mathematician and presenter <strong>Katie Steckles</strong>
- Numberphile and YouTube star <strong>James Grime</strong>
- Mathematician and author <strong>Eugenia Cheng</strong>
- University Challenge star <strong>Bobby Seagull</strong>
- YouTuber/Game Show host <strong>Tom Scott</strong>
- Maths teacher and BBC Radio 4 puzzle writer <strong>Susan-Louise Okereke</strong>

You can find a full list of guests, and links to their parts of the show [here](magic.md).

The show took place alongside <a href="http://watsonathon.com">Mark Watson's 24-hour comedy show Watsonathon</a>, which we appeared on at three points during the day/night ([first](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/786833124?t=161m0s), [second](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/786833124?t=563m0s), [third](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/786833124?t=1017m55s)). Both shows were raising money for the charity <a href="https://www.turn2us.org.uk/">Turn2Us</a> which helps people in low-income jobs & gives out emergency grants, and the <a href="http://www.comedysupportact.org.uk/">Comedy Support Act</a>, supporting comedians and other performers who have little/no income at this time. You can still donate <a href="http://donate.watsonathon.com">on Mark's fundraiser page</a>.
